Banking 04: ACF in an agent loop.

Shows where each hook goes in a real agent. The "model" is a script that does
what a fooled model does: it follows any instruction it reads. It runs the same
task twice, without ACF and with it.

    user request  -> on_prompt
    tool call     -> on_tool_call    (before the tool runs)
    tool result   -> on_tool_result  (before the model reads it)

Run run_sidecar.py first, then:  python examples/banking/04_agent_loop.py
