"""
Banking 03: the provenance rule.

The user asks the agent to pay a bill. The bill names the real payee, and a note
hidden in it names an attacker's account. Neither looks malicious to a scanner
(example 02). ACF records every account number the agent reads in a tool result
as untrusted, and policy.yaml marks send_money's `recipient` as an argument that
must not carry one. So paying the attacker is blocked without recognising any
attack.

The same rule also stops paying the real payee, because that account came from
the same document: ACF cannot tell them apart, only the user can. Declaring the
confirmed payee as trusted lets the payment through while the attacker's account
stays blocked. A value the user typed is trusted from the start.

Run run_sidecar.py first, then:  python examples/banking/03_provenance.py
