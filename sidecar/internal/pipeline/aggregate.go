// aggregate.go — Stage 4 of the pipeline.
// Combines scanner signals into a final risk score (0.0–1.0):
//   - Takes the maximum weight across all emitted signals (avoids score inflation)
//   - Applies provenance trust weight as a multiplier
//   - If State is non-nil (v2), blends in prior_score (placeholder, no-op in v1)

// Signal weights come from signal_weights in policies/v1/data/policy_config.yaml,

// Writes rc.Score. Does not return hardBlock — score-based blocking is decided
