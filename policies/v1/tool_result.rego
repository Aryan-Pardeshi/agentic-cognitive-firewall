# ACF-SDK — Tool Result Hook Policy
# Scope: on_tool_result
#
# A tool's output is untrusted content the agent is about to read, like a
# retrieved document, but the sidecar knows which tool produced it. Output
# from a tool listed in data.config.trusted_tools comes from a source the
# deployment controls (an internal API, say) and is not screened; output from
# any other tool is screened by risk score, as on_context does.
#
# Taxonomy coverage:
#   Trust       → trusted_tools ALLOW
#   Containment → tool_result_threshold ALLOW / SANITISE / BLOCK
